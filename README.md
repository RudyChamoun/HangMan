The game begins by randomly selecting a word from a text file, which changes every time the game is played. Once the user enters their name, they are given the opportunity to guess the word either all at once or letter by letter. The user has a maximum of seven incorrect guesses before the man "hangs" and the game is over. However, keep in mind that if the user chooses to guess the word immediately and gets wrong, the man immediately hangs and itâ€™s game over. To visually represent the "hanging" of the man, the game requires the use of the Bitmap Display, with specific settings of a unit width and height of 2, a display width and height of 256, and a base address of $gp (10000000). Finally, the Bitmap Display must be connected to MIPS and the game code can be run.
One more thing, you just have to run the main.asm file in order to play it, but feel free to load the other files and explore the code.
Note : In order for the game to be run properly not only do you need to connect the bitmap display, but you also need to adjust the path of words.txt containing the guesses that the program will randomly choose from. This is all mentioned inside the main class, refer to it as there will be specific instructions and lines specified to adjust.
